- 👋 Hi, I’m @tdcoder17
- 👀 I’m interested in iOS Development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning iOS Development
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on becoming a better developer
- 📫 How to reach me email: tdavis1736@gmail.com, LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/theophilusdavis/

I am here to join the wonderful world of development! I am a former car salesman looking for a career change.  I have only heard great things about being a developer.
I figured if I am going to be a developer why not be a developer for the products that I love to use everyday(Apple).
Recently I received my iOS Developer certificate from DevMountain. That was over 600 hours of hard work and I am super thankful for everything that I learned there.
So far I have a understanding in: MapKit, UIKit, SwiftUI, Obj C, CloudKit, JSON, GameKit, Lifecycles, MVC, CoreData.
I am here to connect with developers all over and hopefully become a legend in this field while having fun along the way!
